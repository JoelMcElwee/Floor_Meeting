# Floor_Meeting

Floor Meeting is a mobile app that congregates important aspects of the Resident Assistant (RA) role into one interactive piece of software. RAs have a slew of responsibilities, and having multiple applications to fulfill their responsibilities introduces an unneeded amount of stress and error into the process. Streamlining the RA experience not only improves the RA experience but also improves the residence hall experience.

Future features of Floor Meeting include intensive duty and duty planning tools, a task management system, an event and bulletin board inspiration community, a resident interaction portal, and messaging.
